# Chat Client Program (GUI)

## Description

This program is created in order to provide p2p chat service with GUI.

## Environment

This program can only be executed in Windows OS.

## Prerequisite

This program can be executed alone. But for working normally, you should compile and build the source code that was uploaded at [my github repository(StudyOfWinSocket))](https://github.com/Herrtane/StudyOfWinsocket). Follow the instruction written in the 'readme.md' of the url.

## Usage

If you successfully run the multithread chat server, you can execute this client exe file.

1. When you start this program, you can see a 'Login_Dialog' window. Input the server ip, server port, your name.
2. That's all! Now you can chat with other people in the program (if other also connect same server).
